The Document Object Model(DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
Programs can change the document structure ,style and content
Represent the document as nodes and objects ; that way programming language can interact with the page
DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. 
DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language , making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.

Difference between innerText and textContent 
The difference between innerText and textContent is that innerText shows only the visible content that is show on the browser while on the other side textContent shows all the content whether it's visible or not doesn't matter 
<span style="display":none;></span> 
this content is only shown by textContent not by the innerText 
innerHTML -----
In innerHTML it returns all things including HTML content also this is the difference between these three
