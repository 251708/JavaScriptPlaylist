Qus--Do javascript really have classes?
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMA Script 2015
specification . However it's imp  to note that javascript is primarily a prototype based language , and 
its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype based inheritance mechanisms. It provides  a more familiar syntax for 
developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but understood it works somewhat differently
