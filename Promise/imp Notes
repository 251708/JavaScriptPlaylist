Promise
The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an 
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:
pending: initial state, neither fullfilled nor rejected.
fullfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully .
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.


A fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is 
encountered (which is usually when there's a permissions issue or similar) A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP errors(404 ,etc) instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and /or Response.status properties.
