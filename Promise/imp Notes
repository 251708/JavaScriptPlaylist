Promise
The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an 
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:
pending: initial state, neither fullfilled nor rejected.
fullfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully .
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
